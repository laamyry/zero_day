# My First Full Stack
I remember the first time I completed a **full stack** web application. It was an exciting moment, as it marked a major milestone in my journey as a developer. Here's a brief overview of what I built and what I learned:


### The Project

For my first full stack project, I decided to build a simple web application for tracking personal expenses. The application had a basic authentication system and allowed users to add, edit, and delete expenses. The front-end was built with React, and the back-end was built with Node.js and Express. I used MongoDB as the __database__.

## The Learning Experience


Building this application was a challenging but rewarding experience. Here are some of the things I learned:

-   **Planning is key.** Before diving into the code, I spent a lot of time planning out the architecture of the application and the features I wanted to include. This helped me stay organized and focused throughout the development process.
    
-   **Full stack development requires a lot of moving parts.** In order to build a full stack application, I had to understand how to work with multiple technologies and languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It was a lot to take in, but it gave me a solid foundation for future projects.
    
-   **Debugging is a skill in itself.** As with any software development project, I ran into plenty of bugs and errors along the way. I learned the importance of debugging skills and tools like console.log, error messages, and code editors that can help identify issues.
    
-   **Testing is crucial.** I also learned the importance of testing my code thoroughly before deploying it. I used tools like Jest and Enzyme to write unit tests for my front-end code and Mocha and Chai for my back-end code. This helped me catch errors early and improve the quality of my code.
    

Overall, my first full stack project was a valuable learning experience that taught me a lot about web development. I'm excited to continue building more complex applications in the future!
